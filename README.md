# Senior-Design-4-Year-Planner
This is all of the files to my senior design 4 year planner project. It is a website that allows students to select their major and minor and they select what classes they want to take over their 4 years in college
Group that worked on this project: Andy Davis, Ian Vaughn, Willow Stuckey, Tiana Andrews, Jonathan Warren, and myself
